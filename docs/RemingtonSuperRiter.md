## Removing Panels and Splitting Machine

The Super-Riter Machine has been designed for easy accessibility to all working parts. Removal of the Machine Panels is accomplished by first lifting straight upward on Top Cover 2-51361. The Side Panels 2-51357 and 2-51359 may be removed by loosening Side Cover Screw 2-40111 and pulling outward on top of Panels and lifting them upward off of Dowel Pins. The Rear Panel Screws 2-51443 must then be removed and the Rear Panel 2-51363 lifted off the Dowel Pins.

The machine may be split for access to parts located under the carriage, etc., by removing three (3) Screws, "A", from each side of the Frame Back 2-51395. (See Margin Release, Line Lock and Bell Illustration). First, the two (2) Frame Back Anchoring Screws 2-55008, these are located between the Carriage Bed Rails on right and left side of carriage. Care must be used to prevent damage to the teeth on the Carriage Roll Retainer Fixed Rack 2-55151 when removing Screws 2-55008. Second, remove the two (2) Top Screws 2-48072 "A", on right side that hold the Frame Back 2-51395 to the Side Plate. Repeat this operation on left side. Loosen the two (2) Bottom Screws 2-48072 on each side of Frame Back 2-51395. Move entire Frame Back to rear to split the machine.

The entire machine may be removed from the Frame Base 2-51351 by removing the four (4) Screws 2-51360, Nuts 2-40428 and Washers 2-51376. Do not lose Rubber Grommets 2-51411 when removing machine parts.

## Back Space Mechanism

This mechanism is very simple in construction and will require very little adjusting. It is necessary as in all parts of the machine to have free moving parts.

If the back space fails to operate check the following:

See that the Back Space Pawl Spring 2-53518 has sufficient tension to hold the Back Space Pawl 2-53511 clear of the Escapement Wheel Teeth. Also see that the pawl is free in movement and that the Back Space Key Lever Roll is in alignment with the Back Space Lever Arm 2-53502 as illustrated.

The Escapement Rocker Body should be located so that the Loose Dog holds the Escapement Wheel in such a position that the tooth of the Escapement Wheel will be fully engaged by the Back Space Pawl when Back Space is operated. The location of the Escapement Rocker Body is described in the text covering the escapement mechanism.

## Space Key Mechanism

The Space Key Shaft is supported in the machine by Space Key Shaft Pivot Screws 2-40002 and Nuts 2-40411 and when the Space Bar 2-51867 is depressed, it causes the Space Key Shaft Arm, to which the Space Key Push Link 2-41138 is attached, to move upward. The Space Key Push Link Roll contact arms on the Escapement Rocker Body, causing the Escapement to take plate. When the Escapement is complete, the Space Key Spring 2-51866 returns the key to its normal rest position.

### Adjustments

Firstly, the Space Key Shaft Assembled 2-51811 should be free but without end play between its pivots. If there is end play, remove by adjusting pivot Screw 2-40002 making sure that the Lock Nut 2-40411 is securely tightened after making this adjustment.

The height of the Space Bar 2-51867 is correct when the top of Space Bar is level and 5/16" below tops of lower bank of alphabet keys. This adjustment is made by forming the Space Key Upstop 2-41158. After forming Space Key Upstop for Space Bar height, check Line Lock for proper locking of Space Key.

With the Space Bar 2-51867 depressed, the top of the Space Bar should be about flush with top of machine frame base 2-51351 (refer to Panel Sketch). This adjustment is made by adjusting Space Key Downstop Screws 2-40163. Refer to Illustration.

The Space Key Push Link Guide 2-41124 Screw Hole is elongated to facilitate adjusting the Push Link to its proper position. It is preferable to have the Push Link Roll located near the front end of Arm "C". This position makes for an easier space key operation and the Space Key Spring 2-51866 and test Space Key Mechanism for freedom of movement. The Space Key Push Link 2-41138 must be free in its Guide 2-41124. When testing the Space Key Mechanism for freedom of movement hold forward on the lower part of the Escapement Rocker Body, not carefully and bind the linkages. If the mechanism seems to be sluggish or binding, check again for freedom as already explained. Hook up the Space Key Spring 2-51866.

Adjust the Push Link Eccentric 2-41127 until the Escapement takes place when the Space Bar is within 1/16" of the Space Key Downstop Screws 2-40163. If the Eccentric does not give enough movement to the push link to get this condition, it will be necessary to maul or pein the Space Key Shaft Arm at point "A" to lower it, or at point "B" to raise it.

When the Space Key is depressed against Downstop Screws 2-40163 the Escapement Rocker Body 2-42776 must not limit against Upper Rocker Body Stop Screw 2-40100 shown on Escapement Illustration (Rear View).

## Ribbon Drive Mechanism

The drawings covering this mechanism show in detail the assembly of the parts which govern the Ribbon Drive and Reverse. The movement of the parts originate at the Carriage Spring Drum, which through the Spring Drum Pinion 2-46601, Spring Drum Pinion Shaft 2-58110 and Ribbon Drive Gear 2-58122 drives the Ribbon Drive Shaft 2-58098.

On the Ribbon Drive Shaft 2-58098 are mounted two (2) Ribbon Reverse Cams 2-46536 (right or left). Make certain that the cam surface of these cams is set opposite to each other on shaft. The reason for this is in case an operator should take the ribbon completely off the machine, it would permit both ribbon reverse plungers to engage both ribbon reverse cams which would lock up the machine unless the cams were set oppositely. Also, on the Ribbon Drive Shaft is the Ribbon Drive Shaft Detent Collar 2-5801. The Ribbon Reverse Detent Plate Assembled 2-58100 controls the right and left positions of the Ribbon Drive Shaft 2-58098. When the Left Ribbon Driving Gear 2-46537 is in mesh with Left Ribbon Spool Shaft Pinion 2-58087 the ribbon will wind onto the left spool until the right spool is empty. At this point, the Ribbon Reverse Tripping Lever raises and allows the Right Ribbon Reverse Plunger to drop and engage the Right Ribbon Reverse Cam 2-46536 which causes the Ribbon Drive Shaft 2-58098 to be shifted to the right which reverses the travel of the ribbon onto the right or empty spool.

### Removal of Ribbon Drive Shaft 2-58098

To remove Ribbon Drive Gear Pinion 2-46537 on Ribbon Drive Shaft 2-58098 loosen Set Screw 2-40110 in Ribbon Drive Gear Pinion, remove two (2) Mounting Screws 2-40011 for Spring Drum Pinion Support Bracket Assembly 2-58113 in Left Side Frame 2-51348. Employing Fold-A-Matic principle, break machine and pull Ribbon Drive Shaft Assembly complete with Spring Drum Pinion Release Bracket back and out of machine. To replace, reverse the above procedure.

When replacing Ribbon Drive Gear Pinion 2-46537 on Ribbon Drive Shaft 2-58098 make sure Set Screw 2-40110 in pinion is on flat of shaft and pinion is properly meshed with Ribbon Drive Gear 2-58122.

To adjust the Ribbon Reverse Detent 2-58100 loosen Set Screw 2-40110 in Right Ribbon Driving Gear 2-46538. Position stud in slot of Right Driving Gear and with toggle set to rear, mesh Right Driving Gear with teeth of Ribbon Spool Shaft Pinion Gear 2-58087. The gears should be meshed deep enough to ensure positive feed and yet have a slight amount of play between the pinion and drive gear at all positions around the pinion. When correct mesh of the gears has been determined, tighten Set Screw 2-40110 in Driving Gear. Next, slide the Ribbon Drive Shaft Gear Lever 2-58064 to the left, loosen Set Screw in Left Ribbon Drive Shaft Clutch 2-46537 and with Ribbon Reverse Detent Toggle to front, correctly mesh teeth of gear with Ribbon Spool Shaft Pinion Gear Left 2-58087. When correct mesh is obtained, tighten Set Screw 2-40110.

## Ribbon Cover Mechanism

In describing the movement of this mechanism, we will assume that all parts are free and that the adjustments are correct. The Ribbon Universal Bar 2-58107 is supported by the Ribbon Universal Bar Pivot Screw Right 2-40259 and stud left in the base of the machine, under the key levers.

When the Key Lever is depressed, the Ribbon Universal Bar moves downward and as the Universal Bar is on a pivot, Arm "A" moves upward. As upward motion is transferred through the Ribbon Lift Push Link Bell Crank 2-58037 pivots on the Tabulator Bell Crank Shaft 2-42353, the Ribbon Push Link Stud which enters the Slot "C" of the Ribbon Actuator Arm 2-46569, raises the Ribbon Carrier to the desired height.

When the Ribbon Control Lever 2-58038 located on the right side of the machine and attached to the outside of Right Side Plate 2-51355 is in its upward position, it will cause the Ribbon Lift Push Link Stud to be in the front end of the Slot in Ribbon Actuator Arm 2-46569; this causes the type to print on the upper half of the ribbon. When the Ribbon Control Lever is set to its lower position, it causes the Ribbon Control Shaft Lever 2-58024 to move the upper end of the Ribbon Lift Push Link Bell Crank 2-58037 to the rear, positioning Ribbon Lift Push Link Stud to the rear end of Slot "C". This causes the type to print on the lower half of the ribbon.

When the Ribbon Control Lever 2-58038 is set at the white dot or stencil position, the control shaft will hold the Ribbon Lift Push Link in a central position, so that the Ribbon Lift Push Link Stud will move up and down in Slot "C" without operating the Ribbon Carrier 2-46570. When Ribbon Universal Bar and all parts related to the Ribbon Cover are in normal position, the Ribbon Actuator Arm 2-46569 limits on Ribbon Actuator Arm Stop on Ribbon Actuator Arm Bracket 2-58000.

### Adjustments

We will assume that the machine has been adjusted for "on feet" motion, and that the machine is equipped with 1/2 inch black and red ribbon (Machines with larger type are equipped with 9/16 inch ribbon carrier). The black or upper half of the ribbon is adjusted for cover first.

Check the Ribbon Universal Bar 2-58107 for end play on pivots. Excess play should be removed by loosening the Ribbon Universal Bar Pivot Screw Nut 2-40410 and tightening the Pivot Screw 2-40259. Tighten nut when adjustment is completed.

It is important that all play be removed and that the Ribbon Universal Bar is perfectly free. Excess end play in the Ribbon Universal Bar will result in the ribbon not throwing the same distance at all times.

See that the Ribbon Universal Bar 2-58107 is level; this can be tested by depressing key levers z, n, and / - all three type bars should travel the same distance before key levers contact Ribbon Universal Bar.

Loosen the Ribbon Universal Bar Eccentric Screw 2-40065 and set the Ribbon Universal Bar Eccentric 4-12216 with the big side to the front. Lock the Eccentric in this position with the Ribbon Universal Bar Eccentric Screw 2-40065. This is a temporary setting and it may be necessary to adjust it again later.

**NOTE:** There are certain adjustments pertaining to the Ribbon Covering Mechanism that are more accessible with the Typewriter Frame Back open, such as adjusting the Ribbon Control Shaft by Set Screws 2-40240.

Set the Ribbon Control Lever 2-58038 in its stencil position, which is indicated by a white dot on the front panel. Loosen the two (2) Ribbon Control Shaft Arm Set Screws 2-40240 in Hub 2-58021 at the right end of Ribbon Control Shaft Arm 2-58024 and move the Arm until, when a Key Lever is depressed, the Stud will enter directly into the center of the vertical slot at the top of the Slot. The closer this adjustment is made, the better other ribbon covering adjustments will come out. While holding the Arm as described, tighten the two (2) Ribbon Control Shaft Arm Set Screws 2-40240.

Set Ribbon Control Lever 2-58038 to the top position, which is indicated by a blue dot. Ensure the lower Extension is formed, making sure that the stud in Ribbon Control Lever 2-58038 sets securely in its position in Ribbon Control Lever Detent Spring 2-42887. Depress the shift lock key and test the black cover by striking off a few capital "I"s. They should strike in the center of the black or upper half of the ribbon. If the type strikes high on the ribbon, it will be necessary to turn the Ribbon Lift Push Link Bell Crank Eccentric 4-12216 toward the bottom; after adjusting the Eccentric, lock its position with Ribbon Universal Bar Eccentric Screw 2-40065 and try the cover again with capital "I"s. If the type is striking too low on the ribbon, reverse this procedure. Test black covering by typing the alphabet and numerals in both upper and lower cases. It will be found that Eccentric 4-12216 must be correctly adjusted to prevent overthrow and printing the bottom of characters.

Set the Ribbon Control Lever 2-58038 to the red dot, which is the lower half or red ribbon position. Form the Upper Extension, making sure that the Stud in Ribbon Control Lever 2-58038 sets securely in its position in Ribbon Control Lever Detent Spring 2-42887. Strike off the alphabet and numerals in both upper and lower cases. Loosen the two (2) Screws 2-40065 and adjust the Ribbon Actuator Arm Stop 2-46602 until the Ribbon Actuator Arm 2-46569 almost limits against it when the key lever is depressed. This stop prevents the ribbon from overthrowing and failing to print the bottom of red characters. If the ribbon carrier goes up and does not drop back down, it is an indication that the Ribbon Actuator Arm Stop 2-46602 is adjusted too far to the rear.

When Ribbon Control Lever 2-58038 is set at the white dash (-) on the front panel, the face of type will strike in the center of the ribbon; therefore, if a solid black ribbon is used, the customer can obtain more wear from a ribbon by using the center of the ribbon. There is no adjustment on this as it is automatically accomplished if the black and red portions of the ribbon are covering correctly.

When shifting the Ribbon Control Lever 2-58038 from black to red or vice versa, there should be no movement, or flutter in the Ribbon Carrier 2-46570. If the Ribbon Carrier moves, it indicates that the top of Stud 2-40571 is rubbing the top of Slot.

Check the following adjustments in regard to movement in the Ribbon Carrier 2-46570 when shifting the Ribbon Control Lever:
- Ribbon Universal Bar 2-58107 limiting against the undersides of key levers, which could be caused by improperly adjusted Ribbon Universal Bar Eccentric 4-12216.
- One of the individual fingers on the Ribbon Universal Bar may be formed higher than necessary. The fingers on the Universal Bar provide an individual adjustment in case the ribbon carrier does not raise to the proper height for 2 or 3 characters.

The Ribbon Universal Bar, Ribbon Carrier, Ribbon Lift Push Link, etc., are restored to their normal position by the Ribbon Universal Bar Spring 2-51869.

### Key Tension Regulator

When the Key Tension Regulator Lever 2-51861, located at the upper left corner of the Front Panel 2-51365, is set at the up position, the Key Tension is lighter. This lever has three detent positions: top, center, and bottom. The lowest position increases tension and causes type bars to return faster.

### Black Upstop Screw 2-40230

The Black Upstop Screw 2-40230, which is located in the center of the Frame Back 2-51395 directly above the long end of the stud in Ribbon Push Link Arm, will limit the upward throw of Ribbon Push Link Stud when Ribbon Control Lever 2-58038 is set in the upper or black position. The screw should be adjusted to just clear the top of the stud when a type bar is held to the platen by hand.

On wider width carriages, there will be support brackets. Tabulator Rack Support 2-54025, the lower end of this support will be attached to the Tabulator Rack while the upper end will be attached to the top right hole of the Feed Rack Support 2-55090. The Feed Rack Support will be mounted to the underside of the Carriage Feed Roll Support Plate (in the two (2) elongated holes near the center just in front of margin stops).

The lower end of the Feed Rack Support will be held to the Feed Rack with two (2) screws while the hole in the extreme upper end will be attached to the Carriage Support Rail Rear 2-55095. On wider machines, more supports may be used.

## Type Bar Restorer

The Type Bar Restorer 2-52391 is designed in case an operator has a colliding of type bars and they stick near the Type Bar Guide 2-41799 the operator can restore them by pressing downward on the Type Bar Restorer Key Lever Top 2-52409 which is conveniently located at the upper left front corner of the keyboard.

This restorer makes it unnecessary for the operator to touch the face of type, eliminating the necessity of getting ink on hands.

The Type Bar Restorer 2-52391 extends through side frames and is held by Keeper 2-50006 on the left end. The restorer is held to its forward position by the Type Bar Restorer Spring 2-52402 which is attached to the left end of the restorer. The front end of Type Bar Restorer Spring 2-52402 is attached to the stud as illustrated.

Check the restorer in its normal position to see that the restorer does not limit against the Ribbon Drive Shaft 2-58098 (Refer to Ribbon Drive Illustration).

## Shift Mechanism

It is very important that in adjusting the shift mechanism to hold all pivot points and connecting adjustments to a minimum of end play yet still be free in their movement. Any excess play will result in poor alignment and shift motion.

Check the Shift Rocker Shaft 2-53304 for end play between pivot points, play to be removed by Shift Rocker Pivot Screw 2-40002 on the right side of the machine. Tighten Nut 2-40411 securely after adjusting. The end play of the Shift Lever Shaft 2-41808 is removed in the same manner.

We will assume that all adjustments of the shift mechanism are out except those mentioned above. It is important that the adjustments are made in the order listed below:

1. Loosen Segment Shift Stop Screw Nut 2-40410, front and rear, and raise Segment Shift Stop Screws 2-53300 out of position so they will not limit the segment while shifting.

2. Turn Shift Toggle Link Eccentrics "A" and "B" (Shift Mechanism Illustration) so that the high side of the eccentric is at its lowest position. The high side of these eccentrics must always favor the lower half of the eccentric when adjustment is completed.

3. Adjust both Shift Toggle Cushion Eccentrics 2-53331 so that in either upper or lower case the shift toggle links do not travel past a straight line or break center.

4. Adjust Eccentric "A" for capital letters "on feet", by moving the eccentric toward the front of the machine the segment is raised. Check the preceding adjustment after moving Eccentric "A".

5. Adjust the front Segment Shift Stop Screw 2-53300 until there is no noticeable up and down play in segment when shift keys are depressed.

6. Adjust Eccentric "B" for motion.

7. Recheck Shift Toggle Cushion Eccentrics to make sure their adjustments were not changed by adjusting "on feet" and motion.

8. Adjust Rear Segment Stop Screw 2-53300 until there is no noticeable up and down play in the segment when in normal position. Test by trying to move the segment up and down by holding to Type Guide 2-41799.

**NOTE:** Do not run Screw 2-53300 in too far as it will cause a bind in shift keys near latching point.

Check carefully the two (2) Shift Toggle Lever Eccentric Screws 2-40133 to see that they are tight. If loose, the eccentrics will move causing motion and "on feet" adjustments to be thrown out.

Adjust height of shift keys by eccentric directly below the Shift Yielding Spring 2-53334. Shift Key Tops 2-51932 should be 1/16" above regular keyboard.

The Shift Lock Latch Plates 2-53314 right and left are mounted to the Key Lever Comb 2-51808 with two (2) Mounting Screws 2-40013 in each lock plate.

The holes in these plates are elongated. The shift lock latch plates should be set low enough so there will be no variation in the motion of upper and lower case letters: To be tested by locking right and left shift key locks separately and striking off motion (HhHhHhHhHh).

Shift lock plates must also be set even. Make the test for this by locking both shift lock keys. Now release the locks by depressing the left shift key. The lock on the left should release first and the one on the right immediately after. Make this same test by releasing the locks by depressing the right shift key lever. Tighten the Shift Lock Latch Plate Screws 2-40013 after the adjustments have been made.

The tension of the shift mechanism is controlled by the two (2) Shift Balance Springs 2-53336 which are hooked to the lower front part of the Type Bar Segment 2-52304. The upper ends of these springs are hooked to the Top Cover Apron Brackets (right and left). The Shift Toggle Spring 2-53335 helps to restore the shift mechanism and prevents segment from rebounding.

## Escapement And Type Bar Universal Bar

It will be found that the Escapement mechanism of this machine is a part of the Escapement Rocker Bracket 2-57201. It is possible to remove the Escapement Rocker Body 2-42776 from the Escapement Rocker Bracket 2-57201 by loosening one (1) Pivot Screw 2-40164 and Nut 2-40407 and loosening Link Lock Arm Screw 2-40114 and allow Link Lock Arm 2-42605 to drop, releasing Trip Pull Wire and carefully removing the Rocker Body 2-42776 from the machine. Do not lose Rocker Body Tension Spring 2-57205 on removal.

To remove the Escapement Rocker Bracket Assembled 2-57201 from the rear of Frame Back 2-51395 remove three (3) screws 2-40219, remove one Keeper 2-50006 from Line Lock Operating Lever stud and remove Line Lock Operating Lever 2-58501. Remove one (1) Keeper 2-50006 from stud on the right end of Margin Set Release Blade 2-57544, Unhook Margin Stop Set and Margin Release Blade 2-57523 and allow the blade to hang downward. Tilt the machine on back and unhook from inside of Frame Back 2-51395 one (1) Keeper 2-50006 from the lower stud holding Back Space Pawl 2-53511. Unhook pawl from stud and Back Space Pawl Spring 2-53518 from Tabulator Blade Lower Comb 2-51356. Unhook Bell Ringer Spring 2-53906 from Tabulator Blade Lower Comb. Loosen Escapement Link Lock Arm Screw 2-40114 and allow Escapement Link Lock Arm 2-42605 to release Escapement Trip Pull Wire.

Raise Escapement Rocker Bracket Assembled with Escapement and Rocker attached up and off Frame Back carefully as Bell Ringer 2-53905 and Back Space Pawl 2-53511 may be bent.

To replace the mechanism, reverse the above procedure, making sure that the hole in the lower end of Tabulator Friction Stud Arm 2-54033 is placed (as shown in Tabulator Illustration) on the Tabulator Friction Ball 2-42382 and that Escapement Trip Pull Wire is locked by Escapement Link Lock Arm 2-42605.

There are certain adjustments pertaining to this Escapement which should be made when Escapement Mechanism is out of the machine. Remove one of the Escapement Rocker Pivot Screws 2-40164 and take out the Escapement Rocker 2-42776 complete. (Do not lose the Escapement Rocker Spring 2-57205). Remove the Escapement Loose Dog Silencer Stop Screw 2-40081 and Nut 2-40409 from the Tabulator Friction Bracket 2-54000. Remove the Escapement Wheel 2-42755 by taking out the Escapement Wheel Bearing Screw 2-40189, Nut 2-40411, and Washer 2-40958.

On the rear side of the Escapement Wheel 2-42755 will be found the Loose Dog Silencer 2-42623, Silencer Friction Spring 2-42606, and Friction Spring Collar 2-40919. The purpose of the Loose Dog Silencer 2-42623 is to eliminate noise by holding the Loose Dog clear of the Escapement Wheel teeth as the Carriage is being returned, therefore, only enough tension should be put on the Silencer Friction Spring 2-42606 to obtain this result.

The correct tension can be obtained by loosening (2) Set Screws 2-40115 and adjusting Collar 2-40919 which is threaded. Care should be taken on this adjustment; if the collar is screwed on too far it will slow down the carriage speed and make carriage return heavy. After adjusting the collar make sure that the rear side of the collar does not extend beyond the back edge of the Escapement Wheel 2-42755, also ensure that Set Screw 2-40115 in the collar is tight.

A small amount of typewriter oil should be placed on Escapement Wheel Bearing Screw 2-40189 before mounting the Escapement Wheel to the Bracket.

Hold Escapement Wheel 2-42755 onto the Escapement Rocker Bracket 2-57201 using Escapement Wheel Bearing Screw 2-40189 and secure its position with Washer 2-40958 and Nut 2-40411. The Escapement Wheel must be free to turn on the screw but have no noticeable end play. The wheel should also run true.

Replace the Loose Dog Silencer Stop Screw 2-40081 ensuring that it goes through the slot of the Loose Dog Silencer 2-42623 and does not run in far enough to bind the rear side of Escapement Wheel 2-42755. This clearance can be seen by turning the Escapement Wheel until the hole is in line with the front end of Loose Dog Silencer Stop Screw 2-40081.

The Escapement Loose Dog Carrying Arm Screw 2-48013 should be adjusted for the minimum amount of play. Test the Loose Dog 2-42780 for moving freely in the Loose Dog Guide 2-42630, both up and down and to the right or left; check the Escapement Loose Dog Spring 4-10161 for tension. The correct distance between the Loose Dog and Fixed Dog is from .043 to .045. This clearance will control the safety zone which will be mentioned later.

Replace the Escapement Rocker 2-42776 on the Escapement Rocker Bracket 2-57201 and insert Pivot Screw 2-40164. Remove all end play but ensure the Escapement Rocker is free between its pivot points. Insert the Escapement Rocker Spring 2-57205. The Escapement Rocker Spring Adjusting Screw 2-40101 head should be backed out until it is against the Tabulator Friction Bracket 2-54000. If necessary, this screw can be adjusted to put more tension on the Escapement Rocker. The Lower Escapement Rocker Stop Screw 2-40088 should be adjusted until the front edge of the Loose Dog is set .015 to .020 to the rear of the front edge of the Escapement Wheel Tooth. At this point, turn the Escapement Wheel and observe the amount of hold that the Loose Dog Silencer 2-42623 has on the rear edge of the Loose Dog. If the Loose Dog is adjusted too far forward on the Escapement Wheel Teeth, the Silencer will not be able to engage the Loose Dog correctly, and also, the Type Bars would pick up the Escapement Universal Bar too soon which affects the key touch.

Hold the Escapement Wheel 2-42755 against the Loose Dog, causing the Loose Dog to limit against the Escapement Rocker and see that the face of the Loose Dog, where it contacts the teeth of the Escapement Wheel, is flush against each other. This condition is commonly known as six o'clock and is adjusted by moving the Escapement Rocker Pivot Screws 2-40164 to the right or left to get the desired results. After this condition is obtained, check the Escapement Rocker 2-42776 for free with no end play.

Replace the Escapement Rocker Bracket Complete on the machine, making sure that the hole in the lower end of Tabulator Friction Stud Arm 2-54033 is placed (as shown in the Tabulator Illustration) on the Tabulator Friction Ball 2-42382. Place the Escapement Link into position in the Escapement Rocker, retaining it with the Escapement Link Lock Arm 2-42605 by tightening its Screw 2-40114.

Push the "H" Type Bar to the ribbon, the Escapement Trip should take place as the face of the type touches the ribbon. Adjust by loosening Escapement Link Nut 2-40408 and adjust Escapement Link Sleeve 2-42629 until the desired result is obtained. Lock the sleeve with the nut.

After obtaining the trip, hold the Type Bar against the cylinder and test the lower part of the Escapement Rocker for a small additional movement forward. The Upper Escapement Stop Screw 2-40088 should not limit the movement of Escapement Rocker 2-42776. Make this test for the same condition with the Space Bar depressed against its downstops. If not the same, check carefully the Space Bar Adjustments and if the rocker still limits against Upper Stop Screw 2-40088, back it out slightly.

Next, test the escapement safety zone. Raise the "H" Type Bar slowly by hand until the Escapement Trip takes place at the ribbon, then allow the Type Bar to restore to the front of the machine slowly; the second trip of the escapement should occur when the face of the type is 1/2" to 9/16" away from the ribbon. This is controlled entirely by the distance between the Loose Dog and Fixed Dog which is .043 to .045. If the distance is more than 9/16", there is a danger of the operator piling one letter on top of another. If less than 1/2", there is a danger of skipping between letters. If the Escapement Loose Dog Carrying Arm Screw 2-48013 is too tight, it will prevent the Loose Dog from stepping to the left, thereby causing the machine to pile letters occasionally.

The Pica (10 Space) Escapement has (15) teeth on the Escapement Wheel and (15) teeth in the Pinion. The Elite (12 Space) has (18) teeth on the Escapement Wheel and (18) teeth on the Pinion. Since the Feed and Margin Stop Rack 2-57201 is of one-piece construction, it will not be possible for the Margin Stops 2-57504 Right or Left to change their setting when the escapement is removed and replaced in the machine.

The Margin Stop Clearance at the left margin is a set condition and can only be changed by adjusting the six o'clock position of the Escapement Rocker Body.

### Universal Bar

With all the Escapement Adjustments made, we will now test the machine to see if the Type Bar Universal Bar 2-41647 is correctly adjusted.

We will assume that the Type Bar Universal Bar Oscillator Bracket Screws 2-40128 are tight. Also, that the Type Bar Universal Bar Oscillator Pivot Screws 2-40060, Adjusting Bushing 2-52300, and Lock Nut 2-40411 are tight but free with no end play and adjusted in such a position that the Type Bar Universal Bar Guide Stud will be free in the guide hole of the Type Bar Segment. The Type Bar Universal Bar Oscillator Spring 2-52420 gives the oscillator sufficient tension to hold the Type Bar Universal Bar to its forward position. A Rubber Cushion 2-40892 will be found on the Universal Bar Guide Stud. Its purpose is merely to cushion the return of the Type Bar Universal Bar to the Segment.

To test, raise the Type Bar "H" and see that the Escapement takes place as the face of the type touches the ribbon, (as previously instructed). This being correct, we will raise by hand Type Bars #1 and #42 to see that the escapement takes place as the face of the type touches the ribbon. If all three type bars escape at the ribbon, the universal bar is correctly adjusted.

Example #1: We will assume that the Escapement on the "H" Type Bar is correct, but on the #1 Type Bar the Escapement takes place 1/8" before it touches the ribbon. It will be necessary in this case to loosen the left Type Bar Universal Bar Oscillator Pivot Screw 2-40060 and Lock Nut 2-40411 and move to rear slightly. This will make the Escapement on the #1 Type Bar closer to the ribbon. After locating the left Type Bar Universal Bar Oscillator Pivot Screw and Bushing, always check the #42 Type Bar.

When moving the left Type Bar Universal Bar Oscillator Pivot Screw to the rear, the Escapement on the #42 Type Bar will occur a little sooner than it did before, likewise, if the left Type Bar Universal Bar Oscillator Pivot Screw had been moved forward to make the Escapement on the #1 Type Bar escape sooner, it would have caused the Escapement on the #42 Type Bar to escape later. Adjusting Pivot Screws 2-40060 are provided at both ends of the Type Bar Universal Bar Oscillator Bracket 2-52419 and if the Escapement on the #42 Type Bar is not taking place at the ribbon after locating the Left Type Bar Universal Bar Oscillator Pivot Screw, we will follow the same procedure in locating the Right Type Bar Universal Bar Oscillator Pivot Screw.

Example #2: We will assume that the Escapement on Type Bars #1 and #42 are escaping at the ribbon and the Center Type Bar "H" is escaping too late. This condition can be corrected by slightly loosening the two (2) Type Bar Universal Bar Oscillator Bracket Screws 2-40128 and moving downward slightly the Type Bar Universal Bar Oscillator Bracket.

The holes in the Type Bar Universal Bar Oscillator Bracket 2-52419 are oversized for their bracket mounting screws 2-40128, which makes it possible to locate this bracket either up or down. Moving the bracket down will cause the Escapement on the Center Type Bars to occur sooner and at the same time, the Escapement on the End Type Bars #1 and #42 will take place later, therefore, a very slight movement of the Oscillator Bracket 2-52419 is necessary. If the Escapement on the Center Type Bars was taking place before the End Type Bars, it would have been necessary to move the Type Bar Universal Bar Oscillator Bracket up instead of down.

It will be necessary to lower the Frame Back 2-51395 to make the proper adjustments to the Type Bar Universal Bar 2-41647. As the Frame Back is hinged, it will be found possible to adjust the Type Bar Universal Bar 2-41647 and check the adjustment by raising the frame back into position. This will eliminate the use of a gauge and the result will be a more accurate adjustment.

Inasmuch as the Type Bar Segment can be removed and washed without disturbing the Universal Bar, it should seldom need adjusting.

## Tabulator Mechanism

The depressing of the Tabulator Key Bar 2-54045 through Connecting Link 2-42440 causes the rear end of Tabulator Bell Crank 2-42414 (left) to move upward. The Tabulator Bell Crank Adjusting Screw 2-40118 contacts the bottom of the Tabulator Stop Blade 2-42501 and as the Tabulator Blade moves upward it carries the Tabulator Friction Bail 2-42382, which transmits a downward movement to lip "B" on the Escapement Loose Dog Release 4-11607 which lowers the Escapement Loose Dog 2-42769 out of the Escapement Wheel 2-42755, permitting the carriage to tabulate until Tabulator Stop 2-48500 (which is depressed) limits against the top of Tabulator Stop Blade 2-42501, stopping the Carriage.

When the Tabulator Bar is released the Escapement Loose Dog 2-42769 is allowed to restore into the Escapement Wheel 2-42755, before the Tabulator Stop Blade 2-42501 clears the Tabulator Stop, thus preventing the Carriage from tabulating further.

The speed of the carriage on tabulation is controlled by Friction Type Brake. The Tabulator Friction Screw Arm 2-42412 has a friction stud in it, near the center, with the leather headed portion of the stud facing rear side of Escapement Wheel. The movement of the friction screw arm is controlled by the Tabulator Friction Bail 2-42382, as shown on illustration. The amount of brake or friction is controlled by the Tabulator Friction Spring 2-42867 and Friction Spring Screw 2-40101.

When the Tabulator Set Key 2-42459 is operated the Tabulator Stop directly above the Clear Key will be depressed, therefore, it may be cleared out again in case of error by depressing the Tabulator Clear Key 2-42460.

The Tabulator Stops may be restored by depressing the Clear Key and moving the Carriage to the right.

### Adjustments

The Tabulator Key Bar 2-54045, (or Tabulator Keys on Ten Key Machine) Tabulator Clear Key 2-42460 and Tabulator Set Key 2-42459 are held against the Tabulator Key Upstop 2-42352 by their Springs 2-54040 and 2-40329.

When the above keys are in position just described, adjust the Screw 2-40118 in the Tabulator Bell Cranks (right 2-42372 and left 2-42373) until the screws just clear the Tabulator Stop Clear Blade 2-42431, Tabulator Stop Blade 2-42501 and Tabulator Stop Blade 2-42356. When the Tabulator Key Bar 2-54045 or Tabulator Stop Clear Key are depressed the Tabulator Blades limit at point "X", shown on illustration. When the Tabulator Key Bar 2-54045 or Tabulator Clear Key 2-42460 are depressed separately, the tops of the Tabulator Stop Blade 2-42501 and the Tabulator Stop Clear Blade 2-42431 should clear stops in Tabulator Stop Rack 2-54002 about 1/32".

If this condition does not exist and Tabulator Blades are limiting at point "X" shown on illustration, then loosen the two Tabulator Stop Rack Mounting Screws 2-40011 and hold Tabulator Stop Rack to position and tighten screws. Depress Set Key 2-42459 and set up a continuous number of Tabulator Stops 2-48500.

in Tabulator Rack. Depress the Tabulator Key Bar 2-54045 slowly and observe whether the Tabulator Stop Blade 2-42501 comes up centrally between two (2) Tabulator Stops 2-48500. This adjustment is obtained by loosening the two (2) Tabulator Rack Mounting Screws 2-40011 and screwing in or out of the Tabulator Stop Rack Adjusting Screw 2-54041. Be sure that the right end of Tabulator Stop Rack is against this adjusting screw and that the two (2) Tabulator Stop Rack Screws 2-40011 are tight and Lock Nut for Adjusting Screw 2-54041 is set when adjustment is completed.

After locating the Tabulator Stop Rack 2-54002, we will set the Tabulator Stop Set Arm Bracket 2-54031. Lip "A" on top of the Tabulator Set Arm Bracket must contact the tops of Tabulator Stops 2-48500 centrally, and should not set up more than one stop at a time. To adjust, loosen the two (2) Tabulator Set Arm Bracket Screws 2-40065 and locate Set Bracket to right or left as desired. Tighten the two (2) Tabulator Set Arm Bracket Screws 2-40065.

When Tabulator Set Key is operated and Tabulator Stop Set Blade limits at point "X" but the Tabulator Stops are not fully depressed, it indicates that Lip "A" should be formed down slightly. Do not form Lip "A" too low as it may rub on the tops of Tabulator Stops.

Tabulator Key Bar 2-54045 depressed, Loose Dog 2-42769 should clear Escapement Wheel but not limit Loose Dog in bottom of its guide, adjust by forming Loose Dog Release 4-11607 at point "C". Point "B" on Escapement Loose Dog Release should not limit and prevent Loose Dog 2-42769 from coming to correct height.

Adjust Tabulator Friction Arm Support Mounting Screw 2-40230 and Friction Stud so that head of friction stud will contact rear side of Escapement Wheel flush when Tabulator Bar 2-54045 is depressed. Tabulator Friction Bail 2-42382 when in normal position must hold friction stud clear of Escapement Wheel. Adjust by forming the lower end of Tabulator Friction Screw Arm 2-54033 toward front of machine. Friction stud must clear the Escapement Wheel 2-42755 slightly, otherwise it would cause a sluggish moving carriage when operator is typing.  If friction stud clears Escapement Wheel too much, it may not move forward and engage escapement when tabulating.

In case Tabulator Stop Blade hangs on Tabulator Stop 2-48500 and does not restore, loosen Nut 2-40409 on Tabulator Friction Arm Support Screw 2-40230 and back screw toward front of machine slightly - this will relieve pressure and allow Tabulator Blade to restore. Lock Nut 2-40409 after adjustment is completed and check Tabulator Brake Adjustments.

When Tabulator Key, Set Key or Clear Keys are depressed and blades limit at point "X" the lips on Key Lever Comb 2-51808 should be formed upward to limit at approximately the same time.

## "KMC", Margin Release, Line Lock And Bell Mechanism

When the carriage spaces to the left and the Right Margin Stop 2-57504 contacts the Margin Stop Set Release Blade 2-57544 and moves same to left which actuates, the Line Lock Operating Lever 2-58501 which pulls left end of Line Lock Bell Crank 2-58500 away from rear end of Line Lock Push Bar 2-58502 which will permit the Spring 2-58510 at right end of Line Lock Universal Bar 2-58503 to position lip of Line Lock Universal Bar under step on key levers locking same. Spring 2-58509 on Line Lock Bell Crank 2-58500 must be strong enough to push Line Lock Push Bar 2-58502 and also overcome tension of Line Lock Universal Bar Spring 2-58510 to hold Line Lock Universal Bar clear of key levers when typing.

The margin stop clearance at the left margin is a set condition and can only be changed by adjusting the six o'clock position of the escapement rocker body.

The Margin Stop Set and Release Cam Shaft 2-57543 is held in a neutral position by two (2) Springs 2-57535 and 2-57536 connected to the Margin Set and Release Equalizer 2-57526 located inside the lower right side of the Right Side Plate 2-51355.

As the stud in the Margin Release Bell Crank 2-57516 contacts the rear equalizing arm on the margin stop and release Cam Shaft 2-57543 it actuates the Margin Stop Set Release Blade 2-57544 to release right margin by moving same upward at which time the Line Lock Bell Crank Spring 2-58509 causes release blade to move to right over Margin Stop 2-57504.

To pass left margin stop hold down Margin Release Key Lever 2-57516 which will raise Margin Stop Set Release Blade 2-57544 at which time the carriage may be moved to the right by line space lever.

The same connections are used for "KMC" feature except that the "KMC" Key Lever contacts the front equalizing arm of the Margin Set and Release Cam Shaft 2-57543 which rotates shaft in the opposite direction. This lowers the margin stop set and release blade to contact the extension on inside of margin stop, releasing same. The carriage may then be moved in either direction which will automatically set the margin stop to the desired position. It is not essential that the "KMC" key be depressed in any certain position of the carriage as the Margin Set and Release Blade 2-57544 will be cammed into position as either right or left margin stop is moved against it with "KMC" key depressed.

It will be noted that when either the Margin Release or the "KMC" Key contacts one of the equalizing arms on the Margin Stop and release Cam Shaft 2-57543, the other equalizing arm locks the key not being depressed to prevent using both keys at the same time. The bell is tripped by a cam surface on the rear of the Right Margin Stop 2-57504. The Bell Ringer Trip Pawl should be adjusted to raise Bell Hammer 1" from bell before tripping and the bell hammer should not rest against bell when in normal position.

The right and left Margin Stops 2-57504 are interchangeable. These stops can also be used for either Pica or Elite machines.

With parts in normal position adjust Eccentric 2-41127 at rear end of arm on Margin Set and Release Cam Shaft 2-57543 to position top of Margin Stop Set and Release Blade 2-57544 flush with top of Margin Stop 2-57504. Then adjust the Margin Set and Release Stop 2-57525 to limit blade when "KMC" key is depressed before inside portion of Margin Stops limit on Feed and Margin Stop Rack 2-55102 otherwise stops would not move free when being set. The lips of margin stop that engage rack should clear rack teeth approximately 1/32" when "KMC" key is depressed. The Margin Stop Separator 2-57501 floats on the rack between the two (2) margin stops to prevent margin stops from becoming locked together.

In case an operator should tabulate into the Right Margin Stop 2-57504, then the Margin Stop Set and Release Blade 2-57544 would limit against the Line lock Adjusting Plate 2-58508. With machine in this position, try back spacing from right margin stop, If escapement wheel is not held in correct position for back space pawl to engage tooth properly, loosen the line lock adjusting plate mounting screw; also the line lock adjusting plate eccentric screw and adjust eccentric until line lock adjusting plate is properly located. The reason why this adjustment is necessary is because the same margin stop will be used for all machines regardless of the number of spaces to the inch.

After the Feed Rack 2-55102 has been adjusted to proper depth of mesh with pinion, a Roll 2-55385 with Eccentric Screw 2-55384 (as shown in upper left corner of sketch) is provided to hold the feed rack in mesh with pinion at all times and eliminate drag in carriage as it is restored by operator in case any downward pressure is exerted on line space lever, The bottom of roll should only clear shoulder on feed rack about .003" or thickness of a sheet of paper.

## Platen Roll, Line Space Mechanism

In case of trouble with the Variable Line Space Mechanism, see that the parts of the mechanism are lubricated and that the Variable Line Space Clutch Dogs 2-45122, Variable Line Space Clutch Ball 2-40478 and Variable Line Space Clutch Ball Spring 2-42906 are in good condition and functioning properly and Ratchet 2-45040 Teeth are in good condition and not loose on its Variable Line Space Cover 2-45036.

When adjusting the Line Space Mechanism, ensure there is no overthrow or under throw of the Platen Roll after the line space has been completed. The correct position of the roll on the Line Space Ratchet Detent Arm (30 Tooth Ratchet) 2-45126 is when the roll is setting between two teeth of the Ratchet 2-45040 at the time that the Line Space Lever 2-45137 has reached its full travel to the right and the Line Space Pawl is limiting on the Variable Line Space Ratchet 2-45040.

Adjustment is made with the Ratchet Detent Arm Eccentric Screw 2-57090 on which the Line Space Ratchet Detent Arm 2-45126 is mounted. Tighten the Line Space Ratchet Detent Arm Eccentric Screw 2-57090 and Nut 2-40407 when the adjustment has been properly made.

The pressure of the roll on the Line Space Ratchet Detent Arm 2-45126 against the Variable Line Space Ratchet 2-45040 can be adjusted by the Line Space Detent Spring Anchor Eccentric 2-40994 which will locate the Line Space Detent Spring Anchor Plate 2-57004 to front or rear until the desired pressure is obtained.

Platen Roll to turn freely with no noticeable end play, controlled by the Right Platen Thumb Wheel 2-56103 which is locked in position by Platen Thumb Wheel Locking Screw 2-45054 after adjustment is made.

When the left Platen Thumb Wheel 2-56053 is tight, the Variable Line Space Knob 2-56010 must have end play. Test with the Variable set in various positions. No end play in this part would indicate that the Variable Line Space Clutch Ball Spring 2-42906 is sticking which does not allow Variable Line Space Clutch Ball 2-40478 to restore and force the Variable Line Space Clutch Dogs 2-45122 into the ratchet securely, which is necessary to obtain even spacing between lines.

## Carriage

To remove Carriage Complete 2-55338 from the machine, remove two (2) Screws 2-55195 from Frame Back 2-51395, Remove Margin Set and Margin Release Stop 2-57525 and Carriage Roller Bracket 2-55193.

**Caution**: Make a mark, (Pencil mark will do) on the typewriter frame at the bottom of the front carriage rail on each side. The purpose of this mark is to facilitate the relocating of carriage to its proper position which is determined by cylinder and anvil position.

Move carriage to right and unhook Carriage Tape 2-42033 and attach to Carriage Tape Stud in machine frame, with carriage moved to right, remove Carriage Roll Rail Lower Eccentric Screw 2-55008 and Frame Back Anchor Screw 2-55008 located in center of Carriage Bed Rail rear left end. Be careful not to damage teeth on Carriage Roll Retainer Fixed Rack 2-55151, when removing this screw. Move carriage to left and repeat above operation on right end. Do not lose lower Carriage Eccentric 2-55009 when raising Carriage Complete 2-55338 from machine frame.

To replace Carriage Complete 2-55338 to machine frame, reverse the above procedure. Make sure that the Front Carriage Rail 2-55024 is flush with marks on machine frame to maintain previous carriage position.

To remove carriage from Carriage Bed Rails 2-55038, -Remove Carriage Complete 2-55338 as previously explained. Turn carriage over and remove Tabulator Set Key Bracket Screws 2-40065 and remove Set Key Bracket from Carriage End. Loosen two (2) Screws holding Carriage Support Bracket 2-55004 (left), Then carefully move Bed Rail 2-55038 to left from carriage. Care must be taken not to damage Carriage Roll Retainer Bracket 2-55171 and Carriage Retainers 2-55184.

To replace Carriage Bed Rails 2-55038, first check Roll Retainer Bracket 2-55171 that Carriage Retainers 2-55184 are held in raceways of Carriage Bed Rails. Slide carriage bed rail on carriage until carriage retainers are centered within the rails when moving carriage from right to left end and vice versa. Be sure retainers are within rails, Tighten the two (2) screws holding Carriage Support Bracket 2-55004 to Bed Rails. Replace Tabulator Set Key Bracket and tighten Tabulator Set Key Bracket Screws 2-40065. Refer to Tabulator adjustments for correct location of this bracket.

### Carriage Support Rail Rear Bracket 2-55193 And Roller 2-55196

The Carriage Support Rail Rear Bracket 2-55193 is adjusted through its mounting screws 2-40175 to allow the lip a .002 to .003 clearance above the Carriage Support Rail 2-55095. The holes in the Escapement Rocker Bracket 2-57201 are elongated to obtain this adjustment. The carriage support rail must be free in its travel. Check for burrs or any other defect at top of rail to insure a free carriage. The Carriage Support Rail Rear Bracket Roller 2-55196 should be adjusted close enough through its Screw 2-55195 to just contact the Carriage Support Rail 2-55095 its full length of travel. The purpose of this roll is to back up the carriage and platen are properly aligned when printing to maintain even impression and good print work. The roll should be close enough to the rail to provide support and not set so far forward that it affects carriage movement. After tightening, verify the roll is still able to rotate freely.

### Carriage Rails

The Movable Carriage Roll Rail 2-55010 must be free along the full length of the writing line without noticeable play. The Carriage Rear Rail 2-55031 is adjustable to remove play. Since the Screws 2-55158 that hold this rail are not directly accessible, it is advisable to remove the carriage completely, place it upside down, and proceed to adjust the bed rails to align with the movable rail. On "A" length carriages, there are six Screws 2-55158 holding the rear adjustable rail to the bed rail.

The Carriage Roll Retainer Fixed Rack 2-55151 is held by two Screws 2-55160. Adjustments should not disturb its position; however, if adjustment of the Carriage Roll Retainer Fixed Rack is needed, the Carriage Rail Rear 2-55031 would need to be removed. The Carriage Roll Retainer Bracket 2-55171, which also has a rack spot welded in place on the movable Rail 2-55024, must be adjusted accordingly. Ensure the Carriage Roll Retainer Bracket 2-55171 gear meshes properly while still allowing free movement along the full length of the writing line.

When Platen Locks 2-56002 (left) and 2-56003 (right) are holding the Platen Shaft Bushings 2-56016 (left) and 2-56017 (right) in place, there should be no binding in the Platen Roll 2-56040 when the Paper Feed Rolls and Platen Ratchet Roll are released. To maintain this condition, reposition the Platen Roll End Bushing Support 2-56012 to the appropriate side.

### Paper Scale Arm Shaft Assembled 2-55219

To remove the Paper Scale Arm Shaft Assembled 2-55219, remove the Platen, Paper Pan, Feed Rolls, and Paper Bail Scale 2-55268. Be cautious not to lose the lock washers. Separate the machine halves and remove the Aligning Scale Bracket 2-55203 and the Paper Bail Tension Springs 2-55129. Also, remove the two Screws 2-40216 and detach both Paper Scale Arm Shaft Clamps 2-55059. The left screw also secures the semaphore bracket. Extract the two Paper Scale Arm Spring Link Pivot Screws 2-55058. Once the machine is split, the Paper Scale Arm Shaft Assembled 2-55219 can be removed from the machine. Reassembly is the reverse of disassembly.

The improved design of the Paper Scale Arm Shaft 2-55219 allows for four different positions for the operator to locate the Paper Bail Scale 2-55268.

### Semaphore Mechanism

If the left edge of the paper is placed over the slot in the platen, the Semaphore Mechanism 2-56005 alerts the typist that they are nearing the bottom edge of the paper. If red appears in the slot at the left end of the Paper Table 2-51427, it indicates the writing will be within 3/4" to 1" from the bottom of the sheet after which the paper will leave front feed rolls and accurate backing up of work to make a correction would not be possible.

### Aligning Scale And Card Fingers

The Aligning Scale Bracket Assembled 2-55203 (with card tension fingers attached) is held to the Carriage Rail Front 2-55024 by Screws 2-55203. The Aligning Scale 2-45606 is attached to the Aligning Scale Bracket by two (2) Screws 2-40277.

To align the scale to the line of writing, write a full line of small (i's) on the paper across the width of the platen roll. The aligning scale should be level with the line of writing just a very fine line or space between the top of the Carriage Aligning Scale 2-45606 and the bottom of the written line. If high on one side, loosen Screw 2-40277 on the high side and adjust the scale downward slightly. If low, raise the scale in the same manner. This applies to both right and left sides.

**NOTE**: Some side adjustment can be made at this point, if both mounting screws for aligning scale are loose. See adjustment following.

The white lines on the scale should be in line with the vertical lines of the letter (i). The side alignment of the scale is obtained by loosening the two (2) screws holding the Aligning Scale 2-45606 to the Aligning Scale Bracket 2-55203. The holes in the aligning scale bracket are elongated and after the screws are loosened the aligning scale may be moved to the right or left to get the desired result.

The aligning scale should be just far enough away from the platen that six (6) sheets of paper can be inserted between the aligning scale and platen, and also card tension fingers when up. To obtain this condition, form the Aligning Scale Bracket 2-55203.

### Carriage Mounting And Cylinder Anvil Position

The Carriage Support Bracket Left 2-55004 and Carriage Support Bracket Right 2-55005 are mounted to the underside of the Bed Rail by two (2) Screws 2-48072. It will be noticed that the inside slot of these support brackets have an elongated hole for Screws 2-55008. Also at the rear of these support brackets will be found Eccentrics 2-55009 which are used to adjust the carriage to the front or back to obtain cylinder and anvil position. They are correctly adjusted when the carriage is parallel to the machine and when the type bars are held at anvil position, one sheet of paper in carriage for steel anvil and two sheets of paper for rubber anvil, the type should bite a strip of paper at the platen or anvil.

It will also be noticed that the Paper Bail Scale 2-55268 starts at "0" in the center graduating upward on either side. The purpose of the scale being manufactured in this way is to facilitate the operator when centering up headings. The Paper Scale Bail 2-55268 is adjustable laterally.

It will be noticed that Carriage Scale 2-55330 is not adjustable laterally. We are, therefore, dependent upon six o'clock position being correctly set and the accurate manufacturing of parts to obtain this scale setting.

## Type Alignment

To Align a Type, there are so many different ways that this work can be done, that it would be too numerous to write about, but an attempt will be made to give the fundamental descriptions as to how a new Type Bar is replaced, how to solder on a Type and to Align the Type with the rest of the Characters.

There are Right and Left Type Bars, 2-41783 and 2-41784 that can be ordered from the Factory for the Repairmen. These Type Bars will have a "start of a bend" to denote a Right or Left Bar, at where they would enter the Type Bar Guide 2-41799; but this "bend" would have to be completed by the Repairman to suit the Type Bar's location in the Segment 2-54040.

**Soldering Type on Type Bar**: For example, we will assume that the Type Bar for the letter "R" must be replaced. Select the proper Type Bar, take off Top Cover, both Top Cover Aprons, and Front Panel. Remove the Old Type Bar.

**NOTE**: Select a Type Bar that will fit snug in Slot in Type Bar Segment 2-40750 and see that it will return freely to rest position and this is to be determined by the Type Bar Swinging on its Fulcrum Wire 2-41594. If the Bar is too loose in Slot, good Alignment cannot be procured.

As illustrated with Three Prong Pliers, ST-90 29 Figure 5, bend this Type Bar until it will enter its slot in Type Bar Guide 2-41799; at this same time, it will be necessary to bend this Bar into proper angle to enter the Guide with the pair of Tools ST-96292, Figure 5 as indicated, using the narrow slots of these Tools. The "Pin" of the Type Bar must enter straight in the Type Bar Guide 2-41799 which is accomplished by holding the Type Bar steady in narrow slot of lower Tool ST-96292, Figure 5 and twisting this Bar into shape with narrow slot of the other Tool ST-96292. When this Type Bar is perfectly formed and working nicely, in and out of Type Bar Guide and is a good fit in slot of Segment, then it is ready to receive its Type, remove this Type Bar to do this work.

The bottom of the Capital and Small "R's" must come in Alignment, the same as for instance, the "Nn" Figure 7; but as this New Type Bar has never been gauged for the setting of its Type, it will be necessary to select a Type Bar out of the same Machine whose Type is in perfect Alignment and this Bar with its aligned Type, should be of one next to the one that is being replaced; and in this case, we will select the "Tt" Type Bar. In the Type Soldering Fixture ST-96004 Figure 1 and as illustrated, insert the perfect Type Edge of the Wire ST-96004 as the Type Bar Fulcrum Wire 2-40958, the upper Type Bar. The Wire "A" acts the point "J" would be the Anvil position "C" and the Plate "F" Figure 1 would be for the Anvil 2-56203 position.

**NOTE**: The Screw "C" Figure 1 was used to be set for Anvil position to solder Type on Remington Model 16 Type Bars. Do not have this Screw "C" extend beyond face of Fixture at Point "J"! when soldering Type for KMC Typewriters. Loosen Screw "D" and set the fixture "E" until the "Fin" of Type Bar will enter its slot in this Fixture "E", which is the same as the slot in Type Bar Guide 2-41799, then make sure the Screw "D" Figure 1 is absolutely tight. With left thumb bearing down on Type Bar at Anvil position, Point "J", loosen Screw "B" and set the Plate "F" (an Eyeglass comes in handy) until the ridge "H" comes against the bottom of the Small Letter "f" and the face of Plate "F" is flat against the Capital and Small Letters "Ff"'s then securely tighten the Screw "B". Be sure this setting of this Fixture ST-96004 is absolutely correct, for the finer this Adjustment is made with the perfect Aligned Type and its Bar, the better Alignment of the New Type Bar and its Type will be had. Carefully replace this perfect Type Bar that the Fixture was gauged with, with the New Type Bar, care being taken that the Plate "F", does not become disturbed; then carefully loosen Screw "D" until the "Fin" of the New Type Bar will conform with the slot in Fixture "E", then securely tighten the Screw "D" again. Place the New Type with the bottom of the Small Letter "f" to come against the ridge "H" on Plate "F" and at this same time, the Capital and Small Letters of the "Ff"'s to be flat against the face of this Plate "F" and of course, the Type Bar itself in the slot of the Type, then hold down firmly Anvil position, Point "J" and solder this Type to the Type Bar while being heated by an Alcohol or Gas Flame. Just feed enough solder so that the slot in Type will be full and see that no solder gets on the Characters of the Type as this may spoil the Type. Carefully examine to see that the Type did not move out of its gauged position during this operation.

If the Type happens to be of such a Character, say the "Yy", then select the Type Bar "H" as it is next to the "Yy" and set the Fixture ST-96004 Figure 1 to conform to the gauging of the "Hh" Type, the same as was done for the "Ff", but in this case of the "Hh", have the Capital Letter "H" come against the ridge "H" instead of ridge "H" on Plate "F" so that the Capital Letter "H" of the New Type will also come against this ridge "G"; for in this case, the ridge "H" cannot be used as the "tail" of the Small Letter "y" extends below the Alignment as illustrated by the "Hh" and "Yy" Figure 7, for if we were to use the ridge "H" on Plate "F" Figure 1 to Align the Small Letter "h", then the "Yy" Characters would be much too high, out of Alignment with the rest of the Alphabet.

When a Type has been soldered to a Type Bar, replace this and other Type Bars that may have been removed back into the Machine but do not replace from Panel, to cover Aprons or Top Cover at this time. It is customary to Align Type between the "Nn"s. Test the Types that was just resoldered of which the "Rr" was used as an example, to see that it is in Alignment by printing on Paper; NRN and nn. If this "Rr" is much too low or too high with the "Nn"'s, then the gauging of this "Rr" Type with the Fixture ST-96004 Figure 1 was not fine enough and will have to be done all over again. If the "Rr" happens to be in good Alignment as far as the bottom of these Characters are concerned, then Test the Platen and Anvil position. With Finger pressing lightly this "Rr" Type Bar against the Anvil "G" position (do not have Finger above Anvil position) after placing a strip of taper between this Type Bar at this Anvil position and note the pressure of Type Bar holding this strip of paper. Release this Type Bar and place this strip of paper between the Ribbon and Paper in Carriage, then lightly press again this Type Bar with Finger at Anvil position (do not have Finger above Anvil position) and note the amount of bite or hold that the face of Type has at this Platen position. There should be an equal bite or hold at both the Platen and Anvil positions. If there is bite at Anvil position and none at Platen position and this condition at the Platen is not too bad, the Type can be brought a little closer to the Platen by bending the Type Bar with the Tool ST-40120 as arranged and indicated by Figure 2. If this operation caused the Type to be a little low in Alignment with the "Nn", it could be restored into Alignment by nipping the Type Bar as at "Q" Figure 6 by the Starrett Pliers with Jaws "N". If there is bite at Platen position and none at Anvil position, then bend the Type Bar so that the Type will come away at Platen position to allow its Type Bar to come against the Anvil position by reversing the same Tool ST-40120 as shown in Figure 3. If this operation caused the Type to be a little high in Alignment with the "Nn", it could be restored into Alignment by nipping the Type Bar at "P" Figure 6 by the Starrett Pliers with Jaws "N". However, if this Type and Type Bar were much out of proportion in regards with the Anvil and Platen positions, then the Type with its Type Bar should be re-gauged and re-soldered with Type Soldering Fixture ST-96004 Figure 1.

If a Type needs just a little relaxing to bring it in Alignment, nip the Type Bar as at "Q" Figure 6 with Jaws "N". If a Type needs just a little lowering, to bring it into Alignment, nip the Type at "M" with Jaws "N". If the Small Letter only is a little light at its lower part, called "off feet", nip the Type at "M" with Jaws "L". If the top part of this same Small Letter is "off feet", nip the Type as at "S" and in the angle as shown. If the lower part of the Capital Letter is "off feet", nip as at "S", but in this case, reverse this angle. If the top part of the Capital Letter is "off feet", nip as at "R". If the left side of both Capital and Small Letters are "off feet", hold the Type Bar steady with the lower Tool ST-96292 Figure 5 and twist the Type in the proper direction with Tool ST-96276. If this right side of these two (2) Characters are "off feet", then reverse the operation with Tool ST-96276. If left side of the Small Letter happens to be "off feet" while the right side of its Capital Letter is also "off feet", then replace this Type with a new one that does not have this condition. If a particular Type happens to be a little short in its "toptail" that is, the Small Letter is a little higher in Alignment with its Capital Letter, carefully nip the Type at about half way between these two (2) Characters. Be careful that this operation is not overdone, for if the Small Letter happens to get lower in Alignment with its Capital Letter, the Type would have to be replaced with a new one.

Taking the Type "Rr" as an example again, print "RrR". The Small "r" should come in the center of the two (2) Capital "R"s. If this is not the case, then arrange the two (2) Tools ST-96292 Figure 5---- and bend the Type in the proper direction until results are obtained; this is called "centering of type". When a Type is once centered and its Characters are "on feet" all around, but it is found to be to one side or the other and not in the center of the "Nn"s' good side to Alignment, then the Type will have to be "off set" by using the Tool ST-96270 Figure 4. As this Tool is illustrated, it would move the Type towards the left by Jaw "M" while the Type Bar is held by the Jaw "N" which is its Type Bar Guide 2-41799 position. If the Type is to be moved to the right, then turn this Tool around. After using this Tool, center' the Type as already instructed, then see how it Aligns between "Nn"s. Replace Front Panel Top Cover Aprons and Top Cover.

## Questions And Answers

Q 1. What procedure should be used in checking a space key that is misoperating?

A (1) Space key lugs top 2-41158 should be set so that the bottom of the space bar 2-51867 is even with top of machine frame base 2-51351. It will be necessary to remove the unit from the sub base on earlier model machines and remove space key assembled to cut off top of space key lever extensions which contact the key lever top 2-41118 to gain previous adjustment. (See Instruction Letter #33, Paragraph 12 Issued 3-6-51).

A (2) Space key downstops 2-40163 should be set so that when space bar is depressed the top of space bar should be flush with top of machine frame base 2-51351.

A (3) Space key push link eccentric 2-41127 should be adjusted so that trip takes place when the space bar is within 1/16" of the space key downstop screws 2-40163. If the eccentric does not give enough movement to the push link to get this condition, it will be necessary to pin the space key shaft arm on top for less trip or the bottom for more trip.

A (4) Space key shaft should be adjusted in pivot points for tight but free.

A (5) The space key spring 2-51866 should not be stretched or too weak as this would cause a machine to skip or pile on a space key operation.

A (6) The space key push link guide 2-41124 screw hole in elongated and should be adjusted so that the space key push link assembled 2-41138 is set to the front of machine for best space key operation.

A (7) When the space key is depressed against downstop screws 2-40163 the escapement rocker body 2-42776 must not limit its return upward thereby lost stop screw 2-40100 and the escapement rocker body 2-42776 should be adjusted in its pivot screws 2-40164 so there is no side play or binds.

Q 2. How is the Type Bar Universal Bar checked for level?

A Raise Type Bars (1), (21), (42) and check to see that trip occurs at same position.

Q 3. What changes have been made to enable the operator to handle more carbon copies efficiently?

A Feed Roll Brackets 2-57100 and 2-57101 have been changed in order to provide a greater clearance between the Feed Rolls and Cylinders when the Feed Rolls are released. Paper trough support Brackets have been removed Paper trough front windows have been enlarged and Front Feed Rolls have been decreased .025 in diameter.

Q 4. When Left Margins are uneven, what adjustments can be made to correct this condition? How do we get correct "0" setting on front scale?

A The clearance between the left Margin Stop 2-57504 and the Margin Set and Release Blade 2-57502 can be changed by moving the escapement rocker body to the right or left on its pivots. It is advisable to check the 6 o'clock position or install a new Margin Release and Margin Stop plate which has been ground off .020.

Q 5. What change has been made in Super-Riter Feed Roll Tension Springs for more positive tension on Feed Rolls?

A Carriage Support Brackets 2-55004 (Left) and 2-55005 (Right) are now made of single piece of metal to prevent separation of metal and rubber as of old style brackets.

Q 9. What are three (3) adjustments to improve key touch on machines that had the ribbon feeding from Ratchet and Feed Pawls?

A Three adjustments to improve key touch on Universal Bar Ribbon Drive Machines are:

1. Set Ribbon Drive for 80-85 space travel for one full turn of ribbon spool.
2. Adjust Red and Black Upstops to prevent choking Ribbon Carrier travel.
3. Check for clearance between Key Restore Bail and Ribbon Drive Shaft.

(These adjustments are fully explained in MII-169, Issued 12-4-50). Filed in Folder 7-B.

Q 10. How much of the machine would have to be dismantled to level the type bar universal bar 2-52401?

A The top cover, side covers, and back cover would have to be removed first. Remove six (6) screws on the latest style machines with rear cover held by screws, or eight (8) screws on previous style with snap on rear cover. Machine can then be split to adjust type bar U bar 2-52401 so that both end and center bars trip at same point.

Q 11. What is the difference between the latest style ribbon drive and the old style ribbon drive?

A The latest style ribbon drive is driven by the main spring while the old style was driven by the movement of the ribbon universal bar when a key lever was depressed.

Q 12. Is there any difference between left and right margin stops or pica and elite margin stops?

A No, one margin stop 2-57504 is used for all purposes.

Q 13. Why was the shift toggle and eccentrics changed on the Super-Riter?

A The shift toggle 2-53340 and eccentrics 2-53339 were changed to provide a wider range of adjustment. It would be necessary to install the late style shift toggle 2-53340 and eccentrics 2-53339 on a machine-equipped with wide motion type. (See Instruction Letter #33, Issued 3-6-51 Filed in Folder 7-B Paragraph #11).

Q 14. Is it possible to adjust the height of the shift key levers?

A Yes. The height of the shift keys are adjusted by the eccentric directly below the shift yield spring 2-53334. Shift key tops 4-12151 should be set 1/16" above regular keyboard. Shift lock plates will have to be reset after making previous adjustments.

Q 15. What is the proper sequence of steps used in setting a machine that is off feet and out of motion?

A The sequence of steps as outlined in the instruction book must be strictly adhered to in adjusting a machine for "on feet" and "motion". Be sure that all shift mechanism pivot points are adjusted properly and lubricated when making this adjustment.

Q 16. What is wide motion type?

A Wide motion type has the capital and small letters on the type face moved further apart by .038 as compared to regular type. This also means the segment will have to travel a greater distance.

Q 17. Is wide motion type available for installation on Super-Riter?

A Yes, on special requests only at present time.

Q 18. Why would it be necessary to install wide motion type on the Super-Riter?

A It would be necessary to install wide motion type on the Super-Riter when machine is used for excessive amount of carbon copy's to eliminate ticking. When a machine is ticking it means that when the small letter of type is printed the lower part of the capital letter will shadow print and in the same respect if the machine was printing capitals, the upper part of the small letters would shadow print under the capital letters. Ticking will occur more readily if the paper being used is bulky or when 6 or more carbon copies are being used.

Q 19. How can pica and elite wide motion type be identified?

A Wide motion pica type is numbered 534 in the center of the type.
Wide motion elite type is numbered 504 in the center of the type.

Q 20. How can pica and elite regular motion type be identified?

Regular motion elite type is numbered A4 in the center of the type.

Q 21. What grade platen is now recommended for all purpose work on the Super-Riter?

A The grade 3C platen thick wall is now recommended for all purpose work.

Q 22. (A) Is there any difference in the KMC and Super-Riter platens?
(B) Are they interchangeable?

A (A) Yes, the Super-Riter platen is slightly longer, also the distance between the ratchet head and rubber is wider to make room for the paper bail.
(B) No, the platens are not interchangeable.

Q 23. What is meant by pica spacing? Elite spacing?

A Pica spacing means there are 10 letters to every inch of writing.
Elite spacing means there are 12 letters to every inch of writing.

Q 24. Is the segment used for Super-Riter the same as the KMC or #17 machine?

A No, the position of the segment shift stop screws were moved to the right on Super-Riter for easier accessability for adjustment purposes.

Q 25. Is the segment shift rocker 2-53304 used for Super-Riter the same as the KMC or #17 machine?

Q 26. Are capital or small letters set for "on feet" adjustment?

A The capital letters are set for "on feet" adjustment.

Q 27. Where should the high side of the "on feet" and "motion" eccentrics be set at all times?

A The high side of these eccentrics must always favor a downward position.

Q 28. At what point should the type bar escapement trip occur on a Super-Riter?

A Type bar escapement trip should take place as face of type touches the ribbon, Adjust by loosening escapement link nut 2-40408 and adjust escapement link sleeve 2-42629 until desired result is obtained, Lock sleeve with nut 2-40408.

Q 29. Is there a difference between pica and elite escapement pinions and feed and margin stop racks?

A Yes. The elite pinion and escapement wheel 2-42763 has 18 teeth on each while the pica pinion and escapement wheel 2-42755 has 15 teeth on each,

There is also an elite and pica feed and margin stop rack (2-55102 Pica and 2-55109 Elite) for the above pinions.

Q 30. What did this eliminate on tab, margin and scale adjustments as compared to the early Model #17?

A The early Model #17 elite pinion has 15 teeth which did not conform to the 18 teeth on the escapement wheel and because of this an elite machine had to be timed for proper tabulation, and setting of margin rack and carriage scales,

Q 31. What adjustments should be checked after changing cylinder and anvil position of machine?

A (1) It will be necessary to adjust back or forth position of feed rack roller eccentric screw 2-55384 and feed rack roller 2-55385 by loosening feed rack roller sleeve nut 2-55383, and adjusting the feed rack roller sleeve 2-55386 to gain clearance without binding the carriage, The feed rack roller 2-55385 and the feed rack roller eccentric screw 2-55384 should also be adjusted up or down so that bottom of roller 2-55385 clears shoulder on feed rack about .003 full length of the feed rack.

A (2) It is necessary to check the clearance of the carriage support rail rear bracket roller 2-55196. The carriage support rail rear bracket roller 2-55196 should be adjusted through its screw 2-55195 to just contact the carriage support rail 2-55095 its full length of travel in order to maintain good impression and print work.

A (3) The margin stop set release blade 2-57502 should be checked to cam into position as either right or left margin stop is moved against it with KMC key depressed. When the margin stop set release blade does not contact cammed surface of margin stops it will be necessary to use washers between the feed and margin stop rack 2-55102 (10 space) and the left and right carriage ends to shim the feed and margin stop rack 2-55102 (10 space) to the rear for a proper camming action of the margin stop set release blade 2-51502.

A (4) The clearance between carriage front scale and top cover and dust covers should be checked.

A (5) The roll on the escapement loose dog release 4-11607 should be adjusted to just clear the carriage release blade assembled 2-55211, also loose dog should clear escapement wheel but not limit loose dog in the bottom of its guide when carriage release levers are depressed. Adjust by forming escapement loose dog release 4-11607 just below the release blade roll bearing.

A (6) The bell ringer 2-53905 may bind on or miss contact with right margin stop. Adjust by forming the bell ringer trip pawl in or out for proper bell ringer trip operation.

Q 32. How can the at rest position of the ribbon carrier be adjusted to eliminate a flutter when shifting from black to red position or vice versa?

A First check the ribbon universal bar 2-58036 to be clear of the under side of key levers, which could be caused by improperly adjusted ribbon universal eccentric 4-12216 or one of the individual fingers on the universal bar may be formed higher than necessary. After first checking the preceding adjustments the at rest position of the ribbon carrier can be adjusted to eliminate a flutter by forming the lip of the ribbon actuator arm bracket 2-58000 that the ribbon actuator arm 2-46569 rests on.

Q 33. Which color of the ribbon should be adjusted first, black (upper) or red (lower)?

A The black (upper) color of the ribbon should be adjusted first. The black upstop screw 2-40230 and the red upstop 2-46602 should not be limiting the throw of the ribbon when making the ribbon cover adjustments.

Q 34. (A) Which position would the ribbon universal bar eccentric 4-12216 be moved to throw the ribbon higher?

(B) To throw the ribbon lower?

A (A) Before making adjustment the large side of the universal bar eccentric 4-12216 should always be set to the front of machine. To have the ribbon carrier throw higher the ribbon universal bar eccentric 4-12216 should be turned toward the bottom of machine.

A (B) To have the ribbon carrier throw lower the ribbon universal bar eccentric 4-12216 should be turned toward the top of machine.

Q 35. What is the correct setting of the black upstop screw 2-40230 when adjusting the ribbon cover?

A Care should be taken when setting the black upstop screw 2-40230 so as not to limit the ribbon carrier before it reaches its full travel as it would cause a strain in the ribbon cover linkage and would greatly effect the touch of the machine.

Q 36. Is the red ribbon actuator arm upstop 2-46602 in the same position on the Super-Riter as the Electri-Conomy or the KMC?

A The red ribbon actuator arm upstop 2-46602 is positioned in the same place on the Super-Riter as on the Electri-Conomy and the Remington KMC. Care should be taken when setting the red ribbon actuator arm upstop so as not to limit the ribbon carrier before it reaches its full travel as it would cause a strain in the ribbon cover linkage and would greatly effect the touch of the machine.

Q 37. What would be the reasons for improper line space operation?

A (1) Check line space pawl 2-57011, line space regulator 2-57002, and line space detent arm 2-45126 to correspond to the line space ratchet 2-45040.

A (2) The line space ratchet detent arm 2-45126 should be set to the line space ratchet 2-45040 so that the line space pawl arm assembled 2-57011 will not overthrow or underthrow the platen.

A (3) Platen locks right 2-56002 and left 2-56003 should be adjusted to hold the bushings for the platen securely in place.
