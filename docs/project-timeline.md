## Review Analyst Summary - November 27, 2023

Here's a summary of the steps we've taken so far in developing and implementing the AI-driven software system project:

1. **Project Overview and Team Composition:**
    - The project focuses on enhancing the ChatGPT Plus experience through a system operated by specialized AI models.
    - The AI team includes various roles like Project Manager, Business Analyst, UX/UI Designer, Software Architect, and others.

2. **Development of AI Role Prompts:**
    - System prompts for each AI role were crafted, focusing on defining the responsibilities and functions of each role. These prompts are designed to guide AI models in their specific functions within the project.

3. **Testing and Iterative Process Planning:**
    - A strategy for testing and refining the AI models' performance was outlined. This involved an iterative process where each AI model, starting with the Project Manager, responds to prompts and subsequent AI models build on these responses.

4. **Public Engagement Specialist Role Addition:**
    - A new role, the Public Engagement Specialist, was defined to manage public communication and feedback integration.
    - A prompt for initiating conversation with the Public Engagement Specialist was created, focusing on immediate planning and project familiarization.

5. **Iterative Prompt Refinement for AI Team Collaboration:**
    - The process involves the Oversight Manager (human) crafting and adjusting prompts for each AI team member based on their responses and project progression.
    - This iterative process ensures effective communication and task execution among AI team members, with the Oversight Manager guiding the flow of conversation and ensuring alignment with project goals.

6. **Documentation and Reporting:**
    - Steps and processes are being documented for clarity and future reference. The Technical Writer AI role will be instrumental in this process, ensuring all activities and workflows are accurately recorded.

This summary captures the key steps and strategies implemented in the project so far. It can be used by the Technical Writer to document the workflow and provide a clear overview of the project's progression and methodologies.
