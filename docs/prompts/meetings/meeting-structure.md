### Meeting Structure: AI Team Alignment and Task Planning

**Objective:** To align AI team members with project goals and assign initial tasks based on their respective roles. The process will be conducted through a series of asynchronous chat completion requests, with each AI model receiving context and prompts relevant to their role.

### Process:

1. **AI Project Manager: Setting the Stage**
    - The AI Project Manager is provided with the project context and its role prompt.
    - The Project Manager then generates a prompt outlining the project goals, scope, and the importance of each AI model’s role within this framework.

2. **Role-Specific Task Assignment**
    - Each AI team member receives a prompt generated by the Project Manager, including the project context and their specific role prompt.
    - Team members generate responses or action plans based on their role and the given context.

3. **Collaboration and Workflow Planning**
    - The Project Manager synthesizes the initial responses and proposes a workflow and collaboration method.
    - Team members can provide feedback or additional insights based on this proposal.

4. **Communication and Reporting Protocols**
    - The Project Manager establishes initial communication channels and reporting structures, adapted to AI team dynamics.

5. **Risk Management and Compliance Input**
    - The Security Specialist and Legal and Compliance Advisor provide insights on risk management and compliance considerations.

6. **System Development Requirements**
    - The team identifies initial requirements for system functionality to facilitate internal communication and role execution, including the feature for AI models to access each other's role prompts.

### Initial Prompt for AI Project Manager:

---

**Initial Prompt for AI Project Manager:**

As the AI Project Manager, you are initiating the AI team alignment and task planning process. You have been provided with the overall project context and your specific role prompt. Your initial task is to synthesize this information into a comprehensive prompt that outlines the project goals, scope, and the significance of each team member’s role within this framework.

**Your Objectives:**
1. **Outline Project Goals and Scope:** Clearly define the project's objectives, scope, and the importance of aligning all AI models with these goals.
2. **Task Assignment Framework:** Propose an initial framework for task assignments to each AI team member based on their roles.
3. **Workflow and Collaboration Proposal:** Suggest a method for workflow and collaboration, considering the AI nature of the team.
4. **Communication Protocol Setup:** Establish a basic structure for communication and reporting within the AI team.
5. **Invite Risk Management Input:** Generate prompts for the Security Specialist and Legal and Compliance Advisor to provide their inputs.
6. **Identify System Development Needs:** Highlight initial requirements for system functionality enhancements, particularly for internal AI communication and role prompt access.

Please generate a prompt that will be passed to the next AI team member, guiding them to respond or take action according to their role and this project framework.
